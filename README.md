## Downloading READMEs from GitHub using the GitHub API

After inputting a username, the GitHub API is called to create a list of all the public repositories for that user (repo_names). An error displays if a user cannot be found.

The API is called again to search for README files for that username, where {title} is replaced by each public repository name in the list repo_names. This url is used:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{username}/{title}/master/README.md


Note: not all repositories in that list will have a README file on their main/master branch. Only found content will be added to the "content" dictionary.

If there are no READMEs found at all, but the username is valid, a message will display to let the user know.

```
def get_git_data(username):

    # looks up the names of public repositories for that user
    repo_url = f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos"
    response = requests.get(repo_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        repos = response.json()

        # sorts the json data into a list of names of repositories
        repo_names = []
        for repo in repos:
            repo_names.append(repo["name"])

        # searches for README.md files on the main branch of each respository
        for title in repo_names:
            lookup = requests.get(f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{username}/{title}/master/README.md")

            # if found, the README files are stored in a dictionary (called content), sorted by their names.
            if lookup.status_code == 200:
                title = username + " - " + title
                content[title] = lookup.text

        return content

    else:
        raise Exception("We couldnt find a repository list for that user, please try a different username")
```

## Search Function

The search function allows for users to find matches in the files stored on the wiki. If there is a perfect match (punctuation ignored), you are taken straight to that entry, partial matches are displayed on the search.html page.
For instance: seaching "t" will display entries for "Git", "Python" and "HTML".

```
def search(request):
    # get the entry from the search field
    query = request.GET.get('q')

    # check whether the entry is an exact match to a title
    content = util.get_entry(query)

    if content is None:

        partial_match = partial_matches(query, util.list_entries())

        return render(request, "encyclopedia/search.html", {
            "query": query,
            "partial_match": partial_match,
        })
    else:
        title = query
        return entry(request, title)


# function to look for partial matches between the query and exisitng titles, part of search function
def partial_matches(query, entries):
    partial_match = []
    for entry in entries:
        # ignores capitalisation in search results
        if query.lower() in entry.lower():
            partial_match.append(entry)
    return partial_match

```

## Creating and Editing Entries

Forms are used to collect a title and content for an entry.
Entries must be written in Mardown Format.

If a title is unique, it will be stored in the wiki using the util.save_entry function.

The edits page works much the same way, except the forms are pre-populated with the current entry, and there is no check for matching titles, therefore the updated entry simply overwrites the previous.

```
from django import forms

# template for creating and editing entries
class NewEntryForm(forms.Form):
    title = forms.CharField(label="title")
    content = forms.CharField(label="content", widget=forms.Textarea)

def create(request):

    if request.method == "POST":
        # Take in the data the user submitted and save it as form
        form = NewEntryForm(request.POST)

        # Check if form data is valid (server-side)
        if form.is_valid():

            # Isolate the title and content from the 'cleaned' version of form data
            title = form.cleaned_data["title"]
            content = form.cleaned_data["content"]

            # Saves only if the new title does not already exist
            if util.get_entry(title) is None:
                util.save_entry(title, content)
            else:
                error_message = "This Entry Already Exists, please choose another title"

                # returns the form with the fields prepopulated with the content that was previously attempted to submit
                return render(request, "encyclopedia/create.html", {
                "form": NewEntryForm(initial={'title': title, 'content': content}),
                'error_message': error_message,
             })

            # Sends user to newly-created page
            return entry(request, title)

        else:
            return render(request, "encyclopedia/error.html")
    else:
        return render(request, "encyclopedia/create.html", {
            "form": NewEntryForm()
    })
```
